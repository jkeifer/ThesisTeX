\chapter{Discussion}

- Signatures found by kmeans in KS are not wildly variable
  - Perhaps separates pixels that would be considered quite similar using the fitting algorithm
  - Maybe this means the clustering should be based on the fit of each pixel to one another; pixels with low fit values to one another would be grouped together
  
- Notice how the KS clusters roughly delineate fields 
  - Shows that each pixel in a field of multiple pixels typically has a very similar signature to all the others in the field
  - Makes sense as the crops in each pixel grew under the same conditions, so should have the same development
