\chapter{Supplemental Files}
\label{appendix:files}

The source code for the tools documented in \cref{appendix:tools} is included with this thesis. The tools were developed in version 2.7.8 of the Python programming language \autocite{python2.7.8}. Installing the tools is a complex process due to the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) dependency. GDAL is available as a Python Package, but does not come with support for the MODIS HDF4 file format. To use GDAL with this file format, it must be built from source with the correct dependencies and the proper compile options (namely HDF4 support and the Python bindings). How to do this is outside the scope of this documentation; please consult resources specifically about compiling GDAL.

I highly recommend using Python within a virtualenv. When GDAL is installed, the Python bindings are installed to the system Python. To use it within a virtualenv can be complicated. In the virtualenv's directory tree, navigate to lib/python2.7/site-packages. In this folder, create a symlink to your GDAL install's .egg-info directory, and a symlink to the osgeo directory within your system python's site-packages directory. Specifically, the osgeo directory should contain the gdal and ogr .py and .so files. With these symlinks, GDAL will be available for the virtualenv.

The rest of the dependencies can then be installed using the Python package manager pip. With the virtualenv activated, run the command \texttt{\small\$ pip install -r requirements.txt}, and all the other dependencies will be installed. To complete the installation, copy the included files into the project directory of the virtualenv.

To use the command line tools, ensure your virtualenv is activated. Then, cd into the pyhytemporal folder. At your command prompt, type \texttt{\small\$ python commands.py {{-}{-}help}}. This will list the available commands. To see how to use each command, type \texttt{\small\$ python commands.py $<$command\_name$>$ {{-}{-}help}}. All of the arguments and options will be listed.
