\chapter{Conclusion}

When it comes to crop classifiers, agricultural practices are key assumptions. When differences in crop planting and management violate these assumptions, the classifier, and all other similarly-assuming classifiers, break down. The importance of a complete understanding of agricultural practices in the study area must not be underestimated. Such an understanding allows one to choose an appropriate classification method given the conditions. In the case of my work in Pellegrini, the assumptions of my classifier did not match the growing conditions, and the classifier was not as effective as I had initially anticipated.

Rigorous testing and optimization of the classification tools and workflow developed in this study may eliminate some of the current assumptions. I believe such work can only improve classification accuracies and the conditions under which this classifier is useful.  Many ideas for testing and future research are presented in Appendix \ref{appendix:future} in the hope that other researchers will continue this investigation. I am encouraged by the results of this study and see these methods to hold promise for those investigating agriculture and land use and land cover change.
