\chapter{Developing the Processing Tools}
\label{appendix:tools}

Development has been a very iterative process, and has been primarily driven by testing requirements (see \autoref{appendix:testing}). Many of the core functions began as simple proof-of-concepts. As the codebase grew, it underwent significant refactoring. As this is my first major development project, I had to learn, the hard way, how to properly structure a project of this nature. I arrived at many key design principles quite late; some pieces of the project, consequently, were rewritten multiple times. Simultaneously, testing necessitated better ease of use and increased functionality; many features, such as the command line interface to the tools, were added as the need arose and better code organization made implementation possible. With the code as it currently stands, I believe my tools are just as easy to use as GDAL.\footnote{Which, quite honestly, is probably not that easy for most, but should be manageable for anyone with command line experience.}

\section{Review of the classification process}

To reiterate, classifying imagery is a multi-step process. To do so is roughly as follows:

\begin{Spacing}{1.2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Build a multi-date image stack or time series image (TSI) from single-date images.
  \item Find ``pure'' or mostly ``pure'' TSI pixels (eliminate mixels).
  \item Obtain a reference temporal signature for each of the crops to be identified in TSI.
  \item Run the fit algorithm using the phenological reference curves to generate RMSE rasters for each of the input reference signatures.
  \item Use the threshold tool to find the optimal RMSE threshold for each of the RMSE rasters (requires ground truth data for accuracy assessment). This process outputs the final classified image.
\end{enumerate}
\end{Spacing}

Steps 1, 3, 4, and 5 have been implemented as command line tools, each of which is detailed below. Step 2 is currently a manual process, the procedure for which is detailed in section \autoref{methods:mixels} on \autopageref{methods:mixels}; how this step was established is explained in \autoref{appendix:testing:r2} on \autopageref{appendix:testing:r2}. A few other command line tools, such as to plot signatures or to create masked rasters, were also developed, but are not described here. The full source code for the project is hosted on github: https://github.com/jkeifer/pyHytemporal. 

\section{Creating Time Series Images}
\label{appendix:tools:build}

Before I could complete any testing, I had to first determine a way to create a chronological multi-date image stack---a time series image (TSI)---in which the values of each pixel represent the temporal signature of its contents. A TSI can be thought of as the temporal equivalent of a hyperspectral data cube, and is the primary data structure used in the analysis.

Despite the fancy terminology, however, a TSI (or hyperspectral data cube, for that matter) is merely a multi-band raster file, where each band is the data from a given date. Abstracting this concept a step further, a raster is simply a multi-dimensional array. A single-band raster is therefore a two-dimensional array where the columns and rows of the image are represented by the columns and rows of the array, and the data are single-dimension values in each cell. Adding multiple bands, or in this case dates, to the image is easily accomplished by adding a third dimension to the array.

The Geographic Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) Python bindings and the Numpy library include objects and functions which make opening spatially-enabled raster files as arrays, saving arrays to spatially-enabled raster files, and manipulating arrays in memory trivial tasks. Thus, creating a tool to build a TSI from a selection of single-date raster files was straightforward and easy, and did not require any extensive or involved testing.

The finished tool I call the Build Multidate Image tool. It simply requires the user to specify a directory containing the MODIS .hdf files that will be assembled into a TSI. Users can specify which VI the tool should extract from the .hdf files as an optional argument; the default is to use NDVI.

\section{Extracting Reference Temporal Signatures}
\label{appendix:tools:extract}

I hope future libraries of temporal signatures will allow researchers to use temporal classification tools without needing to derive their own signatures. Unfortunately, such resources are not available now. The lack of these resources necessitated that I devise a tool to create such signatures. I named this tool the Extract Signatures Tool (EST).

I decided, in order to maximize ease of use, the tool should use a set of vector points as the input. For each point, the tool finds the TSI pixel coordinates, then extracts the temporal signature of the pixel at those coordinates. Averaging the signatures extracted from all the input points gives the reference signature for that class, which is written to a file for later use.

To implement this solution, I created a module of vector functions. This library included a function to take the geographic coordinates of each point in a shapefile and convert them into a list of pixel coordinates in a specified image. I wrote a function to read pixel values from each band of a multi-band image given a list of pixel coordinates. The extracted values are saved in a text file for later use and in memory for further processing. Another function finds the mean value for each band, writing the result to another file with the format shown in \autoref{fig:reffile}. These functions allow a user to read in the values of a class of pixels in a TSI defined by a series of points stored in a shapefile. Then, the user can find the average values across those points, which is the reference temporal signature of that class. Each of the text files was in plain-text ASII format, and I decided to use the file extension .ref.

\begin{ssfigure}

  \label{fig:reffile}
\end{ssfigure}

I based the formatting of the .ref files on the .sig files used by ENVI for hyperspectral signatures. Using a plain-text file-based data format currently seems to be the best solution for storing reference signatures, as the data are simply structured and text files are highly portable. However, future implementations of the EST may benefit from a more rigid or better contained data format. In particular, a format that supports storing multiple values per date would allow multi-date, multi-band analyses.


\section{The Fit Algorithm}
\label{appendix:tools:fit}

Developing the fit algorithm and the corresponding tool was the most complex problem I had to solve. As described in \autoref{methods:phenology-fitting} (\autopageref{methods:phenology-fitting}), the basis of the algorithm is \autoref{eq:1}. The equation finds the average difference (the RMSE) between a pixel signature and a reference signature, while allowing the reference be transformed within predefined bounds. Minimizing the equation enables the degree of fit between a reference signature and a pixel signature to be quantified. To implement the algorithm, I used the minimize function in the Scipy Python library. I began by building the simplest implementation possible, testing artificial data hard-coded into the script. When that worked, I begin converting as many parameters as possible into function arguments to allow future testing of each. I continued building functionality until I had a tool capable of reading in a TSI from a user-specified file path and reference temporal signature .ref files in a user-specified directory. The tool could then process TSIs using signature .ref files, and output a RMSE raster corresponding to each signature. The value of a pixel in a RMSE raster is the RMSE between the reference temporal signature and the same pixel in the TSI.

One clear problem early on was speed. Pythonâ€™s global interpreter lock (GIL), intended to increase the security and reliability of running python code, also has the consequence of limiting code execution to a single processor core. With current multicore processor designs, the GIL prohibits python from using much of the available processing resources. For example, in my eight-core computer, I was limited to using only 12.5 percent of its processing capabilities. Consequently, I could only process a single signature file at a time, and the total execution time was quite lengthy. Processing five reference signatures required each RMSE raster to be produced consecutively, despite available cores in my CPU.

To get around the GIL restrictions, I redesigned the tool to allow the use of the Python multiprocessing module. Using multiprocessing, I was able to spawn a new worker process for each reference signature (limited to a maximum number of processes as specified by the user). Each process could use an entire core to produce an RMSE raster. At first, this seemed to be a great solution: when using five reference signatures, I could produce all five RMSE rasters simultaneously in one-fifth the time. However, the parallel use of resources is not as straightforward as it seems.

In the later stages of testing, I began getting a serious error when attempting to generate the RMSE rasters. I am unsure why the problems started; it may be related to some code refactoring. I know that it had not occurred in earlier testing as the issue resulted in a fatal error: the program would try to read in a pixel from the TSI and would get a null value. Strangely, this issue would always happen on the twentieth row of the TSI. Even stranger, printing pixel values to standard out before the offending line in the program would ``fix'' the problem and the program would continue without errors. However, careful investigation revealed that the value returned from problem pixels was invalid (often being zero for every band, or a repeating pattern of negative numbers).

As a test, I eliminating parallelism without refactoring by using just a single worker process. Thus, the same code would run, but only a single process would access the GDAL raster object in memory. Removing  concurrent access to that object also removed the errors, proving this was the problem. I tried using the multiprocessing lock construct to prevent multiple processes from reading the image object simultaneously, but this had no effect. Finally, after reading the multiprocessing documentation yet again, I tried reading the entire TSI into a three-dimensional array in memory, as arrays seemed safer in concurrent applications. With this change, the problem disappeared, even using multiple processes. Additionally, this solution had the benefit of providing a moderate speed boost. Unfortunately this solution also raises the memory requirements of the program: the entire TSI must be read into memory, and all the arrays for the output RMSE rasters are also in memory. The memory footprint, consequently, is roughly equal to $s(n + 1)$ where $s$ is the size, in bytes, of the TSI image, and $n$ is the number of worker processes.

Another problem I had throughout development involved pixel coordinates. Numpy arrays use matrix-style coordinates in row-column order, while GDAL functions require coordinates in terms of x-offset and y-offset, which is actually column-row order. This problem was especially pervasive during refactoring, because in many places I switched from GDAL raster objects to arrays to boost performance. If I failed to change all the other calls to that object, I would end up accessing pixels with the wrong coordinate order.\footnote{One piece of advice to anyone developing raster tools: do not use square test rasters. Doing so hides many such bugs. For example, if the pixel coordinates are accidentally supplied in row-column format when a function is expecting column-row order, a square image will never throw an error, whereas a rectangular image will result in an error when the index of the array is out of bounds. Many otherwise subtle programming errors can be caught this way.}

Using the algorithm is easy, as it has a command line interface through the Find Fit Tool. Due to the numerous parameters required by the algorithm, the command has many options. However, it only requires that the user specify the the path to the TSI image, the TSI's start day-of-year, the TSI's day-of-year interval, and the path to the directory containing the .ref reference signature files to be fit. All of the other options require user input only if the user wants to use non-default values.


\section{Creating a Classification From the RMSE Rasters}
\label{appendix:tools:classify}

Merely finding the RMSE rasters does not a classification make. The first step in creating a classification is to find useable RMSE values: even pixels that are obviously different than a reference signature will result in a measurable RMSE value, they will simply be high RMSE values. Thus, the RMSE rasters need to be thresholded to eliminate such high RMSEs.

However, how does one determine which RMSE values are valid, or are too high? Choosing a value at which to threshold the RMSE rasters is not a simple decision. One can think of the threshold in a similar manner to weighting: a higher RMSE threshold will allow more pixels from that RMSE raster to be considered in the final classification. The correct threshold for a RMSE raster will vary depending on a variety of factors, including what types of crops are in the sample area, what crops are trying to be identified, and how homogeneous the pixels for that crop are in comparison to the reference signature used. The extent to which these and other factors influence the optimal threshold is not well understood and requires further study. Despite not knowing the exact effects of these factors on the optimal threshold value, it is clear that the optimal value will vary between RMSE rasters. That is, a single value used across all RMSE rasters in a classification is unlikely to provide the highest possible accuracy.

Once the RMSE rasters are thresholded, one can make a classification by finding the best fit for every pixel. For example, if a given pixel had thresholded RMSE values for corn, soy, and wheat of 356.7, 531.5, and none (as the original RMSE was above the threshold used), respectively, the best fitting signature would be corn, and the pixel could be classified as corn. If a pixel did not have any RMSE values under the threshold used, then that pixel would not be classified (a classification as ``other'' would be equally correct).

In order to automate this thresholding/best fit process, and to provide a means to quickly iterate through possible RMSE threshold combinations, I created a command line tool called the Classify Tool. The tool requires the user to specify the RMSE rasters to be classified, a truth raster, and RMSE threshold parameters. The threshold parameters allow the user to specify the starting RMSE threshold value, the number of RMSE threshold steps to test, and a RMSE threshold step value (how much to increase the threshold each step). The truth raster is ground truth for the entire classified area, and is assumed to match the RMSE rastersâ€™ pixel grids exactly and cover the same geographic extent (such that every pixel coordinate in the RMSE rasters and truth raster will describe the same geographic location and extent). From these parameters, the tool will automatically generate every possible threshold combination. Then, the tool will brute force through those combinations, creating a classification with each and checking the accuracy against the truth raster. Once completed, the tool outputs the classification raster with the highest accuracy and a report detailing each threshold combination tested with a confusion matrix for each.
