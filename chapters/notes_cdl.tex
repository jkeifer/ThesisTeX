\chapter{Notes on the CDL}
\label{appendix:cdl}

Some of the test results and opinions I present throughout this document may lead the reader to question the USDA CDL as source of ground truth data. I believe everyone should approach data critically, and I do not feel badly for the criticism I present of this dataset. My critique is based on my own experience with the data and rumors that have made it to me about the trouble of others with these data. Some have expressed reservations about the published accuracies.

%I also must wonder about the published kappa values for the 2012 Kansas CDL: is kappa not a measure of overall accuracy, and conditional kappa a measure within a given class? Even so, why do all the kappa values seem to be the percent accuracies divided by 100? 

Despite all this, I must make three disclaimers about my opinions.

First, I must admit, all my experience has been with the CDL in Kansas. I cannot speak to the accuracy of CDL in other states. I have heard that some other regions are less problematic, though without evidence supporting either view. Perhaps this is the case, and users should have fewer problems in other areas.

Secondly, I must also acknowledge my study sites were fairly small, and I only worked closely with the CDL in study site 1 (see \cref{fig:studysites}, which might happen to be an anomalous area with a lower-than-average accuracy. Again, other areas may not have the problems I experienced.

Thirdly, I do not have a way to quantify the problems I have observed or to verify the CDL is wrong in the ways I believe it is. Consequentially, all the errors I've found may be within the accuracy range as published, and I should not be as critical of the dataset as I am.

In all, the CDL is a fantastically ambitious dataset, and I do not want to suggest that the USDA has failed. Even if the data have problems, the USDA are classifying the entire continental United States, which has extremely variable conditions and an incredible variety of land covers. That the USDA can achieve any reasonable classification at all is impressive.
