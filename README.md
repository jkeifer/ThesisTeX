ThesisTeX
=========

This is the xelatex source of my master's thesis.

**Find the thesis-compressed.pdf file above to view the lastest committed version in a rendered format.**

All of the content has been approved my by advisor, my committee has signed off on the final draft, my defense was successful, and the Office of Graduate Studies has approved my formatting. Therefore, the latest committed version is the final version which has been submitted to the university and will be made available on the pdx scholar service.

I do not plan to make any further changes or revisions to this document. I do plan create a new repo with my template stripped of all content, so future PSU geography students (or those in other departments; I will attempt to make the AAG formatting modular so it can be separated from the rest of the project) can use it for their theses and dissertations.
