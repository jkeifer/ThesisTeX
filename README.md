ThesisTeX
=========

This is the xelatex source of my master's thesis.


**Find the thesis.pdf file above to view the lastest committed version in a rendered format.**


Keep in mind that revisions are constantly occurring. Much of the content is being drafted in Scrivener and is not pushed to this repository, so many changes in content will not be reflected here until further-refined drafts are moved into the latex environment for more final formatting and revisions. As sections approach completion, I will list them here.

**Currently, the status of each of the chapters/document elements are as follows:**
 - Title Page: Formatting is in line with OGS spec; needs a new title
 - Preface: Solid idea, but has not been written
 - Background: Probably almost as complete as it will be until absolute final revisions; needs some minor additions
 - Study Area: Needs some more content about basic geography of the areas, and single Kansas study site, but mostly complete
 - Data and Methods: Nearing completion, but still requires a few sections and some additional content
 - Results: No Content
 - Discussion: No Content
 - Conclusion: No Content
 - Appendix 1: Field Work -- Still requires some final formatting, links, and facts
 - Appendix 2: Development -- Still requires some final formatting, links, and facts
 - Appendix 3: Testing -- Almost all content is in place, still requires final formatting and links
 - Appendix 4: Future Testing -- Still requires some final formatting and links
