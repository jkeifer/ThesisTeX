ThesisTeX
=========

This is the xelatex source of my master's thesis.


Find the thesis.pdf file above to view the lastest committed version in a rendered format.


Keep in mind that revisions are constantly occurring. Much of the content is being drafted in Scrivener and is not pushed to this repository, so many changes in content will not be reflected here until further-refined drafts are moved into the latex environment for more final formatting and revisions. As sections approach completion, I will list them here.

Currently, the sections that are approaching completion are:
 - No sections are yet near completion. Much of the current content is merely copied from my thesis proposal and will undergo major revisions and/or additions.
